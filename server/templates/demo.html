    Hello world! This is an HTML sub-page sent by touching an api route.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Different than a main page because the <em>filename</em> is not the same
        as the <em>route</em> name
      </li>
      <li>
        Look at the address bar to find our "route"
        <ul>
          <li>It will be something like '/api/templateDemo'</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Check out /server/templates/demo.html to find our "filename"</li>
      <p>
        If this were PHP days, this file would be static information about your website. In fact, when "dynamic" was first coined, what it meant was partly dynamic, like this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that case, a client would send a request to the server, and receive a full page back. That model is rare now, because it does not work well with multiple types of client devices - phones, laptops, watches and so on. It's much easier to write an application for the device that will digest information and present it in a device-specific format.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS can help a bunch with that - the internet is fluid! - but it is easier to divide human labour into more specific design work. This page has seven lines of CSS on it, which is how it comes to look slightly better than "no CSS at all."
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though static page retrieval is very fast after the first load, we do not focus on it in this class, because it is not as fast as sending data separate from structure and format.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </body>
